                            p Ensuring all citizens have a digital ID isn&rsquo;t just the foundation of e-government, but it will also lead to increased efficiency and, therefore, satisfaction from citizens interacting with government services.

                            p Businesses of all sorts need all kinds of licenses to operate. With paper documents, storage takes up space and the documents become easily disorganized, whilst this is completed rapidly with blockchain-based digital solutions.

                            p Registering land in the name of an entity or citizen can take an extended period of time and corruption can mire the process, meaning it can drag on for months. With e-government, this process is transparent and efficient.

                            p Registering a vehicle can be a long and arduous process with documents becoming lost and problems arising with regards to vehicle ownership. By using immutable blockchain-based solutions, owners can be sure of the full vehicle history.

                            p Many agreements between counterparties need to be registered with the government for their validity to be confirmed. Blockchain simplifies this process by making document management digital and network based.

                            p Governments have their own supply chain problems that are more complicated by the bureaucracy of the system being so large. Reducing bureaucracy and going paperless will eliminate many of these problems.

                            p Attestations are currently issued in paper format with many institutions holding copies, in addition to the certificate recipient. However, these documents can be easily falsified and their validity cannot be checked as information is kept in data silos. Distributed networks therefore reduce the opaque nature of the system.

                            p Ballot box stuffing and political apathy are big issues for democratic systems. Blockchain-based voting systems make it simpler to cast ballots, whilst voting data is chronologically stored and can be verified where necessary.

                            p Any property titles held by citizens can be entered as a registry onto the blockchain, making any asset transfers that subsequently take place more efficient and easier to tax due to the heightened transparency of the system.

                            p Citizens can hold funds digitally in so called wallets, and these funds can be used to conduct financial transactions with the state, for example: paying fines or settling tax debts before the state.
