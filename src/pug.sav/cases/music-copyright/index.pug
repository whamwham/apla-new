The system ensures the author receives fair compensation for each stream of their music, no matter if they are famous or completely unknown. The highest level of security and transparency is provided for music industry without any intermediaries.                    p                        | The application became part of the interactive installation called &quot;The Spectrum&quot; for the Bitbank stall at Sonic Visions Bar, Luxembourg. The Spectrum demo illustrated a collaborative creation cycle: from digital consolidated track to materialised digital rights. Every visitor was able to record their own music track and publish it on the digital marketplace, &quot;sell&quot; the rights and get paid. This deeply empowering experience helped people discover how DRM (Digital Rights Management) can evolve with the blockchain, and how it will simplify rights protection and facilitate monetization.                section                    h2 Our contributions                    ul                        li Strategy                        li Process workflow research                        li User research                    ul                        li Development of ecosystem                        li Software application architecture                        li Quality assurance                    ul                        li Technical documentation                        li Third party security audit                        li Fully-functional product (go live)        .screen-background.lazy(data-src="/assets/images/cases/music-copyright/background-screen.jpg")            .container                h2 Background                p                    | Copyright management is one of the biggest pain points in the music industry.
