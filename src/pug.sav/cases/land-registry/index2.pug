                    p  The Government of India is simplifying their services for customers by going digital and using blockchain technology. As part of this drive, in 2017 they decided to reinvent the land registry experience.
                    p  After an exhaustive search for the right partner, the Government of Andhra Pradesh chose Apla to design &amp; engineer a new digital platform that could respond to modern needs &amp; behaviors.
                    p  We partnered with the Government of India to design and develop the world&rsquo;s first blockchain land registry proof of concept that meets the needs of modern citizens. We created a working prototype in just 8 days. It was well-received &amp; endorsed by the client. $700 million saved on bribes alone. Apla&rsquo;s solution increases operational speeds by 10 times, decreases the number of paper documents from 3,000 to 1 and saves billions with improved process efficiency
