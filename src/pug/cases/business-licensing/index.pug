But starting a new business is always complicated: it requires notarizing documents, opening bank accounts, paying fees and much more.

It takes up to 10 working days and requires tons of paperwork.                    p                        | In April 2017, the Government Entity in UAE focused on helping businesses thrive in the economy using blockchain. Apla created a solution where every step of the licensing process can be completed digitally, at least 50% faster and easier than before.
