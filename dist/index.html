        <section>
          <div class="item">
            <h4>Decentralisation</h4>
            <p>All the resources — including data, smart-contracts and user interfaces - are stored on every node inside the network. Any change to data can only be made via smart contract execution. This makes it impossible for anyone in network to tamper with the data.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <h4>Security first</h4>
            <p>The Apla platform was initially design for governments, so security was essential and the first thing to consider. We are working hard to make the Apla blockchain platform completely secure. Only standardised cryptography and hashing algorithms are used, and there is a Bug Bounty program in partnership with HackerOne too.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <h4>Rapid application development</h4>
            <p>App development with Apla doesn’t require any specific knowledge about how P2P networks operate. It allows you to test new ideas and develop Proof of Concepts several times faster. Once dApp development is finished, the dApp can be used on desktop, mobile devices or via web interfaces.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <h4>Truly democratic governance</h4>
            <p>Network governance or critical decision making can be done in a truly democratic manner using the voting mechanism. Once enough users vote, a smart contract is executed automatically to perform the particular action voted for.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <h4>Single platform for everything</h4>
            <p>Everything that is needed for an app to function is already in place, including tools for smart contract development, the building of user interfaces and database table management. This means that you don’t need to write as much code to create your dApp. Moreover, this means that there are fewer potential vulnerabilities in you dApps.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="item">
            <h4>Flexible access rights management</h4>
            <p>Access rights can be configured for every action, including the execution of smart contracts, editing of any interface or working with data. <br>You can also allow data to be read from one single table or add new data tables for users who have specific roles, or configure smart contract execution only where specific conditions are met.</p>
